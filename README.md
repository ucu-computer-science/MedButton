# Project name: MedButton

### Second year POC semester project

# Idea: 
The task of combat medics is to provide first aid to the wounded soldiers as soon as possible. The device for calling combat medics with geolocation makes it possible to find the wounded in a minimum of time. 

With our device for transmitting geolocation data we take care of:
- secure data transfer
- fuse (does not allow a soldier to use the device accidentally)
- secure wounded soldier identification  (to minimize the call of medics by enemies) 
- convenient device allocation

# Technologies:
MCU: PSoC 6 \
Data location: GPS module 

Data collecting:
- temperature sensor
- pulse sensor 

Data transferring: 
- LORA module 
- GPRS module
