# PSoC 6 MCU: GPIO Interrupt

This code example demonstrates the use of a GPIO configured as an input pin to generate interrupts on PSoC® 6 MCU. The GPIO signal interrupts the CPU and executes a user-defined Interrupt Service Routine (ISR). The GPIO interrupt acts as a wakeup source to wake the CPU from Deep Sleep.

## Hardware Setup

This example uses the board's default configuration. See the kit user guide to ensure that the board is configured correctly.

**Note**: The PSoC 6 BLE Pioneer Kit and the PSoC 6 WiFi-BT Pioneer Kit ship with KitProg2 installed. ModusToolbox software requires KitProg3. Before using this code example, make sure that the board is upgraded to KitProg3. The tool and instructions are available in the [Firmware Loader](https://github.com/cypresssemiconductorco/Firmware-loader) GitHub repository. If you do not upgrade, you will see an error like "unable to find CMSIS-DAP device" or "KitProg firmware is out of date".

## Software Setup

Install a terminal emulator if you don't have one. Instructions in this document use [Tera Term](https://ttssh2.osdn.jp/index.html.en).

## Using the Code Example

### In Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox:

1. Click the **New Application** link in the Quick Panel (or, use **File** > **New** > **ModusToolbox Application**).

2. Pick a kit supported by the code example from the list shown in the **Project Creator - Choose Board Support Package (BSP)** dialog.

   When you select a supported kit, the example is reconfigured automatically to work with the kit. To work with a different supported kit later, use the **Library Manager** to choose the BSP for the supported kit. You can use the Library Manager to select or update the BSP and firmware libraries used in this application. To access the Library Manager, right-click the application name from the Project Workspace window in the IDE, and select **ModusToolbox** > **Library Manager**.

   You can also just start the application creation process again and select a different kit.

   If you want to use the application for a kit not listed here, you may need to update the source files. If the kit does not have the required resources, the application may not work.

3. In the **Project Creator - Choose Board Support Package (BSP)** dialog, choose the example.

4. Optionally, update the **Application Name:** and **Location** fields with the application name and local path where the application is created.

5. Click **Create** and complete the application creation process.

For more details, see the Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox User Guide: *{ModusToolbox install directory}/ide_{version}/docs/mt_ide_user_guide.pdf*.

### In Command-line Interface (CLI):

1. Download and unzip this repository onto your local machine, or clone the repository.

2. Open a CLI terminal and navigate to the application folder. On Linux and macOS, you can use any terminal application. On Windows, navigate to the modus-shell directory (*{ModusToolbox install directory}/tools_\<version>/modus-shell*) and run *Cygwin.bat*.

3. Import the required libraries by executing the `make getlibs` command.

### In Third-party IDEs:

1. Follow the instructions from the CLI section to download or clone the repository, and import the libraries using the `make getlibs` command.

2. Export the application to a supported IDE using the `make <ide>` command.

3. Follow the instructions displayed in the terminal to create or import the application as an IDE project.

For more details, see the *Exporting to IDEs* section of the ModusToolbox User Guide: *{ModusToolbox install directory}/ide_{version}/docs/mtb_user_guide.pdf*.

## Operation

1. Connect the board to your PC using the provided USB cable through the USB connector.

2. Open a terminal program and select the KitProg3 COM port. Set the serial port parameters to 8N1 and 115200 baud.

3. Program the board.

   ### Using Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox:

   1. Select the application project in the Project Explorer.

   2. In the **Quick Panel**, scroll down, and click **\<Application Name> Program (KitProg3)**.

   ### Using CLI:

   1. From the terminal, execute the `make program` command to build and program the application using the default toolchain to the default target. You can specify a target and toolchain manually:
        ```
        make program TARGET=<BSP> TOOLCHAIN=<toolchain>
        ```
        Example:

        ```
        make program TARGET=CY8CPROTO-062-4343W TOOLCHAIN=GCC_ARM
        ```
        **Note**:  Before building the application, ensure that the *deps* folder contains the BSP file (*TARGET_xxx.lib*) corresponding to the TARGET. Execute the `make getlibs` command to fetch the BSP contents before building the application.

4. After successful programming, the terminal should display the message shown in [Figure 1](#figure-1-sample-output) . 
    ##### Figure 1. Sample Output
   ![Terminal Output](images/TerminalOutput.png)
   
   Also, observe that the user LED blinks four times and then turns OFF, indicating that the CPU has entered deep sleep.

5. Press the user button to trigger an interrupt. This should wake up the device, causing the LED to resume blinking at a faster rate (default = 2 Hz). The faster blink rate indicates that the ISR has executed to change the delay variable used to determine the LED blink rate. The LED blinks four times and the device enters deep sleep again.

6. Press the button again to repeat the wakeup cycle, and the LED resumes blinking at the slower rate (default = 1 Hz). With every interrupt and execution of ISR, the interval of blinking is alternated between the slower and faster rates.

## Debugging
You can debug the example to step through the code. In the IDE, use the **\<Application Name> Debug (KitProg3)** configuration in the **Quick Panel**. For more details, see *Program and Debug* section in the Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox User Guide: *{ModusToolbox install directory}/ide_{version}/docs/mt_ide_user_guide.pdf*.

## Design and Implementation
This code example uses a GPIO interrupt to wake the Arm® Cortex®-M4 CPU from deep sleep. An LED is connected to an output pin; it is used for indicating the current state of the CPU. A blinking LED indicates that the CPU is active. After four successive blinks, the CPU is instructed to enter deep sleep. The GPIO state is retained during deep sleep, so the LED stops blinking and stays OFF to indicate that the CPU is in deep sleep.

An input pin, externally connected to a switch, is configured to generate an interrupt when the switch is pressed. The interrupt triggers the following two actions:

1. Generates a signal that wakes the CPU from deep sleep

2. Executes an ISR

When the ISR is executed, a flag is updated, which is used to change the rate of blinking the LED. With every press of the switch, the LED alternates the blinking interval.
